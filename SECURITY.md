### When to Report

Please report any security vulnerability if you discover:

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerabilities
- **Injection attacks** (SQL, HTML, CSS, etc.)
- **Authentication or authorization** bypass
- **Exposure of sensitive information**
- **Security misconfigurations**
- **Vulnerable dependencies**
- **Any other security-related issues**

### What NOT to Report

The following are **not** considered security vulnerabilities:

- Bugs that don't have security implications
- Feature requests
- Issues with third-party services
- Social engineering attempts
- Physical security issues
- Issues that require physical access to a user's device

## How to Report

### Private Disclosure (Recommended)

For security vulnerabilities, please **do not** open a public GitHub issue. Instead:

1. **Email**: <security@timecoin.io>
2. **Subject**: "SECURITY: [Brief Description]"
3. **Include**:
   - Detailed description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if available)
   - Your contact information

### PGP Encryption (Optional)

For highly sensitive reports, you may encrypt your email using our PGP key:

```text
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
[PGP Key will be added when available]
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```

### Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports according to the following timeline:

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 3 business days
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity

#### Severity Classification

| Severity | Description | Response Time |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Critical** | Can be exploited remotely; affects all users | 24-48 hours |
| **High** | Significant impact; affects many users | 3-7 days |
| **Medium** | Moderate impact; affects some users | 7-14 days |
| **Low** | Minor impact; affects few users | 14-30 days |

## Our Security Process

### What Happens After You Report

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll confirm receipt of your report
2. **Investigation**: We'll investigate and validate the issue

- ‚úÖ **No External Dependencies** - Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only
- ‚úÖ **Input Validation** - All user inputs sanitized
- ‚úÖ **Regular Updates** - Dependencies kept current
- ‚úÖ **Security Headers** - Proper HTTP security headers
- ‚úÖ **Open Source** - Code publicly auditable

### Planned Security Enhancements

- [ ] Automated security scanning
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability checks
- [ ] Regular security audits
- [ ] Bug bounty program (post-mainnet)

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

If you're contributing to the TIME Coin website, please:

### Do's

- ‚úÖ **Validate all inputs** - Never trust user input
- ‚úÖ **Escape output** - Prevent XSS vulnerabilities

- ‚úÖ **Follow secure coding practices** - OWASP guidelines
- ‚úÖ **Test for security issues** - Before submitting PRs

### Don'ts

- ‚ùå **Don't store sensitive data** - No API keys, passwords, etc.
- ‚ùå **Don't use eval()** - Or other dangerous JavaScript functions
- ‚ùå **Don't trust user input** - Always validate and sanitize
- ‚ùå **Don't use inline JavaScript** - Use external scripts with CSP
